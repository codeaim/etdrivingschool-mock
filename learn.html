                    If the steering becomes heavy, the power assisted steering may be faulty. Before starting a journey
                    two
                    simple checks can be made:
                    1) Gentle pressure on the steering wheel, maintained whilst the engine is started, should result in
                    slight but noticeable movement as the system begins to operate.
                    2) Turning the steering wheel just after moving off will give an immediate indication that the power
                    assisted steering is functioning correctly.
